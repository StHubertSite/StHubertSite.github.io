            <h2>Proposal Story</h2>
            <p>Picnic and story here!</p>
            <p>
              Laura went to trader joes to grab food for the party that night.
              She also picked up food for our picnic and picked the ring up for
              me.
              <br />
              She gave me the ring and then gave us the paper bag with food.
              <br />
              <br />I drove Olivia to the farm for the picnic and we drove down
              to the loop. We got out and wanted to sit by the old concrete
              building next to the barn. There were two small cows hanging out
              there so we looked for another spot.
              <br />
              We went to the other side of the barn and concrete house, and it
              was clear. We made our way around the manure and found a nice spot
              in the grass. We put down the blanket, it was a child design
              featuring the continents and animals. There was a giraffe and
              south America.
              <br />
              We opened our bottles of kombucha, and Olivia’s sprayed on her. I
              asked if she needed napkins from my car, but she told me she was
              fine.
              <br />
              We both ate a chicken wrap and had chips, banana chips, and I had
              some chocolate mints. It was all good and we talked a bit. It was
              a nice picnic, but I was not super hungry and wanted food to
              digest. I asked Olivia to take a walk with me.
              <br />
              We were already at the barn so the walk down the road would not
              have been very long. When we got to the garden, I asked Olivia if
              we could go into a field. The field was full of morning glories
              and blue chicories. The grass was tall, and the weather was
              perfect! There were some clouds, and the sun shone on us, Olivia’s
              face glowed.
              <br />
              We crawled underneath the electric wire careful not to touch it. I
              took her hand and walked to the center of the field. I pulled out
              my Litany of Trust and asked her to pray it with me. I led and she
              followed. Afterwards I asked to pray so we closed our eyes, and I
              put my hands on hers in a prayerful way. I thanked God for today
              and the weather, our beautiful relationship, stressing how God is
              at the center of it all. My focus was to make God a part of the
              proposal because He is the center of our relationship. The Holy
              Spirit is the love that brings Olivia and me together. As I finish
              the prayer, I move my left hand to my back left pocket glancing to
              see that Olivia’s eyes are still closed. I feel the small, skinny
              box in my hand and pull it out, keeping it behind my back. I
              fiddle with it while still praying, trying to get the box opened.
              As we finish the prayer, I get down on my right knee and pull the
              box out.
              <br />
              “Olivia, Will you marry me?”
              <br />
              “I will!”
              <br />
              Olivia takes the ring and slides it onto her ring finger. She
              examines the ring’s beauty and is overfilled with joy. She falls
              into my arms and begins to cry. I held her, comforting and
              expressing my love for her. We kiss and are both overjoyed.
              <br />
              <br />
              <br />
              We walk in the field; I lift Olivia skyward and want to spin her
              around! She is all mine, and I am all hers! I hug her tight and
              she wraps her arms around my head. We kiss and I bring her down. I
              ask her if it feels like a dream.
              <br />
              “Yes!”
              <br />I ask Olivia if it feels real.
              <br />
              “No”
              <br />
              It is the most amazing feeling in the whole world. Nothing else
              mattered but our love.
              <br />I ask if she will run with me. We hold hands and spring
              through the flowers. I ran ahead a couple yards and caught her.
              She runs into my arms, and I lift her high! Olivia is the love of
              my life and so, so good!
              <br />
              We continue to walk and talk and share our feelings.
              <br />
              <br />
              <br />
              Leaving the field, we crawl under the electric fence. We are
              careful to avoid getting shocked and I comment/think about if she
              got engaged then shocked! Luckily, we did not and walked back to
              the barn to finish our picnic. Olivia climbs over the fence first
              and “OWWWW!”
              <br />
              Her bare shoulder brushed against the electric wire that goes
              straight up to the roof. It was in the shade and was basically
              invisible. I felt so sorry for her and rubbed the irritating mark.
              I climbed over the fence and kissed her burn. We laughed about it
              and continued to the picnic spot.
              <br />
              We returned to the spot where we had moved our bag. I had draped
              the blanket over the bag to protect the contents from the sun and
              animals. There was a curious little cow roaming around the bag. We
              take the blanket and bag, and the calf follows up. We put down the
              blanket and the cow stayed close to the bag as if it is expecting
              to be fed! The calf is nice company other than the flies.
              <br />
              <br />
              Olivia pulls out one of the salads for us to share. She opened the
              dressing and spilled it on herself. I thought “I should have
              grabbed the napkins when we were coming back!” I got over the
              fence and to the car to grab napkins. When I climbed back over the
              fence, I saw that the cow had indeed followed me! I rushed back to
              Olivia and the cow looked for me in the barn. I clean up the
              dressing for Olivia and pour it on the salad.
              <br />
              During this time, I thought about how she was going to show her
              family, especially her siblings.
              <br />
              <br />
              Back at my car I get my camera out since all my belongings were
              packed in the car. I take some shots of Olivia and closeups of the
              ring. She looks incredible! She is just of pretty and her whole
              face was shining!
              <br />
              <br />
              <br />
              When we got back to the house, I expected a lot of commotion, but
              it was quiet. Her parents are in the office space, and she
              immediately showed them. Laura gave Olivia a hug and both were so
              excited! Everyone else is in the backyard so she rushed out to
              show them. They ran up to her and Anna was very excited. Faith
              made some comment and Cora asked something? Iris was at work and
              Joel was with friends. Olivia immediately sent a picture to Joel
              that she quickly took with her flip phone. He calls Olivia and
              asks what we are doing and why!
              <br />
              Laura gets her camera and takes us to the backyard. We stand with
              each other in front of the trees by the patio and she takes great
              pictures! I go the computer and copy them onto mine and Olivia’s
              phones.
              <br />
              <br />
              <br />
              After a while I finally must leave. Faith and Olivia help me bring
              my things to my car and I say goodbye. Cora and Fatih would not
              leave me alone, so I blew Olivia a kiss and drove off.
